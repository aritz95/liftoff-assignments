For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This Recipe App quickly provides users with a wide range of recipes based on what they find in their own kitchen.  After signing up, the user can start creating a list of ingredients they currently have within their home.  In return, recipes will populate based on the ingredients given.  Users will have the ability to add recipes to a list of favorites, which will be accessible in the provided 'Favorites' tab on the user account.  The ability to search for recipes is also implemented, which allows the user to go beyond what they may have in their pantry and create a new shopping list.  In time, ingredients listed can be compared by price and location in different stores.

### Features

1. User Account - Users will be able to create an account and login.  Once logged in they will have access to all recipes and have the ability to save recipes to a "favorites" tab.
2. Grocery List - This feature allows the user to add, delete, and edit the quantity each ingredient they need or want.
3. Recipe Search - This feature will allow recipes to be populated based on the ingredients provided by the user to be searched.

### What I'll Have to Learn
In order to get this project functioning properly, I will need to learn how to incorporate different APIs.  I have not yet worked with an API, so this will be a completely new learning experience for me.
